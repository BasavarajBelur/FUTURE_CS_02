## FUTURE_CS_02

A Password Strength Analyzer tool can be created using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI), re (regular expressions) for pattern matching to analyze the password's strength, and hashlib to handle any cryptographic checks (if needed). Below is a breakdown of how you can implement such a tool:

## COMPONENTS/LIBRAIRES OF SYSTEM
1. Tkinter (GUI) Setup:
Tkinter provides a simple way to create the GUI for the tool. It will allow users to input passwords and see results like password strength, suggestions, or warnings.

You'll need a text entry box for the password input and a label to show the strength of the password (e.g., Weak, Strong , Moderate).

2. Regular Expressions (Regex):
Regular expressions (re module) will be used to analyze the password based on certain criteria. For example, we may want to check if:
The password contains at least one uppercase letter.
It contains at least one lowercase letter.
It has at least one digit.
It has special characters like !@#.
It is of a certain minimum length.
Using regex, we can implement these checks to evaluate password strength.

3. Hashlib (optional for security):
The hashlib module can be used to hash passwords securely. This is useful for encrypting passwords before storing them, ensuring that even if the system is compromised, plain text passwords arenâ€™t exposed.
Example: You could hash the password entered by the user and display its hash value to show how it could be stored securely.
